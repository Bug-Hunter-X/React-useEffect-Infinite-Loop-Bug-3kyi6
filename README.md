# React useEffect Infinite Loop

This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by an incorrectly used `useEffect` hook.  The `useEffect` hook is powerful but requires careful handling of dependencies to avoid unintended re-renders.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected code.
